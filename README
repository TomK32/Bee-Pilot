Bee Pilot is a game where you send out the bees from your hive to collect honey.

Gameplay
========
In your hive you see several bees, click and drag them to a flower in the garden 
and then to more flowers. The bee will automatically return after the last flower
and you'll get the score from her honey collecting.
